What have I learned:

-To create a responsive website using Bootstrap -Grid ( the website has been designed to respond, or adapt, based on the technology and type of computing device used by the visitor to display the site.)

-To use advanced CSS :Media Query Breackponts ,Combining Selectors,Selector Priority

-To refactor the code :Readability,Modularity,Efficiency,Lenght

-To create a website that people love:understanding Color Theory,Thypography,Manage attention with effective UI Design and UX Design

A short description:

For better structure and more modularity the code was organized  as folow:

1.In body created:6 sections: title,feature,testimonials,press,pricing,cta(call and action)

2.Because exists a pattern acros the website: created in section a class="colored-section" or class="white-section" 
based on what ever is a colored section or white section background

3.To can easely change the style or make correction in te code created foloed classes:
   -add to h1 in section heading the class="big-heading"
   -add to h2 in section testimonials the class="price-text"
   -add to h3 in section feature the class="feature-title"

4.To aplie a more specific css rule to the that will override the previous create the containe-fluid in title selector
as folow: #title.container-fluid{...}

5.Because in section #title the text is align-left create the Media Queri @media -when the title goes in to the mobile
mode we still whant to change the thext-align center.
